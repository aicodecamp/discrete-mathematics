## Exercise 15
HAHAHA, the exercise 15 was so stupid that I forgot to solve it.
Was just it:
> Evaluate [1,2,3] for theorem 27 and check if is true.:

```haskell
-- theorem 27
(reverse (reverse xs)) = xs
```

Whose, in that case, stands for true.
The problem with this is theorem is just for
when xs is a infinite list. For finite lists this works fine.
